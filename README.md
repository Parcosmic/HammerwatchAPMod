# Hammerwatch Archipelago Mod
This is the new Archipelago mod for the hack and slash dungeon crawler game Hammerwatch. Check out [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg/) or 
the [Archipelago GitHub](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) for information about what Archipelago is!

This version of the mod uses Harmony (specifically [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX/wiki)) to patch the game during runtime rather than using a bsdiff. This makes for a cleaner installation and easier uninstallation!

## Hammerwatch Mod Installation Procedures

Download and extract the .zip file containing the installer and necessary files from the 
[Releases](https://github.com/Parcosmic/HammerwatchAPMod/releases) page. Run HammerwatchAPModInstaller.exe, and
in the file dialogue box select your Hammerwatch executable (Hammerwatch.exe), or navigate to it if it is not
automatically selected. If the installer displays the message "Patching successful!" you know the mod is successfully
installed! You may launch Hammerwatch as normal using Steam to play with Archipelago.

To uninstall the mod run APModUninstall.bat to remove all mod files.
